# Spotify Playlist Organizer

#### Date: 2025/10/22

#### By Casey Waweru

## Description
A simple playlist organizer for Spotify that helps remove repeated songs in the playlist. Especially helpful when you have collaborative playlists with someone cause you can end up adding the same song without realizing and spotify doesn't have functionality to prevent this.

## Installation Requirements
Node

### Installation instruction
```
git clone https://github.com/CaseyWachiuri/Spotify-Playlist-Organizer.git
npm install

```
### Installation instruction
The application is still in its test phases. I would highly recommend not running it on your actual playlists. Currently, when you run the application, it entries of a song if it has been duplicated. Work is underway to find a workaround with this issue in order to ensure it only deletes the duplicates.
