# Spotify Playlist Organizer

#### Date: 2025/10/22

#### By Casey Waweru

### WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The application is still in its test phases. I would highly recommend not running it as is. Currently, when you run the application, it deletes all entries of a song if it has been duplicated. Work is underway to find a workaround with this issue in order to ensure it only deletes the duplicates.

### Recommendation
Create a toy playlist in your Spotify to play around with the application. It was fun working with the Spotify Developer APi and I highly recommend this project to anyone who just wants to have a base to playaround with the API. Any criticism or improvements would be greatly appreciated.

## Description
A simple playlist organizer for Spotify that helps remove repeated songs in the playlist. Especially helpful when you have collaborative playlists with someone cause you can end up adding the same song without realizing and spotify doesn't have functionality to prevent this.
